# Escape_Room_Game

A 2D puzzle where players use mouse and keyboard interactions to solve puzzles and escape the room. Built with Python and Pygame, this project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming principles to create an engaging and interactive experience.

## Description


This is my first major Python project, created as a hands-on learning experience for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Pygame development. The game places players in a 2D environment where they must solve puzzles to escape a room. Key features include:

* Interactive elements: Players interact with objects in the environment using mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.
* Multiple puzzles.
* Object Oriented structure for game objects, rooms, and interactions: : The game's structure is built using OOP concepts for maintainability and scalability.
* A start menu: Providing a user-friendly entry point to the gameplay.

The game utilizes Pygame to manage graphics, user input, and the core game loop.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Pygame (Used Version 2.2.0)
* Pycripter (Used Version 3.6)

### Installing

* Ensure to extract the "Blaec_Font_1_1.zip" file before running the program on an IDE that is compatible with Pygame (recommend Pyscripter).
